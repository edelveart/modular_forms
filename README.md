# Modular forms

Explore a primer on the mathematical symmetries of `Modular Forms` through algorithmic composition and live coding with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

## Features

- **Accessibility for musicians and coders**: No need to be a math expert to jump in. Whether you are a musician curious about code or a coder intrigued by sound, this tool lets you explore modular forms in a creative and intuitive way. You will be able to generate musical patterns, rhythms, timbres, and harmoniesâ€”playing with math like it were an instrument.
- **Interactive Educational Tool**: Use **Sonic Pi** to teach number theory concepts in a hands-on, immersive way. Allow students to experiment with live coding, hear math in action, and understand abstract concepts through sound.

## Purpose and Scope

Given the vastness of the field, we intentionally focused on a limited subset of concepts, such as Eisenstein series or Dedekind functions, which are often studied at an introductory level.
[See the full list below.](#implemented-modular-forms-generators-and-operations)

- **Not optimized for high performance**: This library is not intended to guarantee maximum efficiency or to replace advanced mathematical software.
- **Normalized modular functions**: Several of these modular functions are normalized, ensuring consistent and standard q-expansions for musical applications.

The goal is simple: offer an inviting starting point for those who might not have a strong math background, but still wish to explore, learn, and possibly uncover new ideas.

## Installation

You can install the `modular_forms` gem directly from **RubyGems** or clone it from GitHub.

```bash
gem install modular_forms
```

## How to use?

You can dive into the beauty of math, both in Ruby and Sonic Pi, creating music in real-time.  Here is a simple example of how to use **modular_forms** to generate a basic musical pattern:

```rb
require 'modular_forms'

# Calculate the Eisenstein series of weight k = 4
eisenstein_melody = ModularForms.eisenstein_serie(4)

# Play the melody in a loop with a mathematical transformation
120.times do
  play eisenstein_melody.next % 12 * 7
  sleep 0.5
end
```
